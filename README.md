# Meet-the-Team

## Description

My motivation behind this project was to design a program in which I could generate a team profile using node. I built this project to demonstrate my capabilites in node as well as jest and inquirer. This solves the problem of generating a new webpage for each new team that is designed. I learned through building this project how to run tests using jest. How to use contructors and pass objects. I didnt commit my project throughout its build because I was unsure how to generate a gitignore file that would keep node modules from my github. I used a website to generate a gitignore for me. A note: even though the video features a bug where a span was not added to the section where the intern's email is built in, in the repo, that span is added. I only noticed the bug once I had recorded the functionality. 

## Installation
 
 You need to install node to have the program work, additionally you will also need inquirer. Jest also needs to be installed to run the test files. Once you have all of the necessary packages, you can then run the program by typing in node index.js into the terminal and follow the prompt when asked about the necessary team members. 

## Usage

The following video demonstrates much of the functionality of the project. This project runs through node which allows you to add team members and has a stop feature once you are done adding team members. The porgram allows the users to open up your email app when I click on the email that correspondes to each employee. Although in the video, there is bug with the intern, this bug is fixed in the repo, the program also establishes a link to the engineer's github.

## Credits

The gitignore was created by https://www.toptal.com/developers/gitignore/api/node,macos

This project was created from help from professor Diarmud. 

This project also uses components from Bootstrap which made the html easy to build.

## Tests

Video demonstrates the tests that are associated with the project. There are a total of four test files, each one testing each possible contructor.
